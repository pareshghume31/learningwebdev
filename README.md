# learningwebdev
I'm currently practicing basic web development, revisiting and strengthening my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My passion for web development drives me to continuously improve my skills and stay updated with the latest technologies. Alongside this, I'm learning Git and GitHub to efficiently manage and share my projects.

My goal is to push all my content to GitHub, creating a resource that anyone interested in web development can easily access and learn from. By sharing my projects, I hope to build an interactive and collaborative learning environment.

Feel free to explore my repositories, provide feedback, and contribute to the projects. Let's learn and grow together in the world of web development!

Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!
