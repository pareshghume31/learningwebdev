      >A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In
      other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from
      an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a
      function is created, at function creation time</b

          console.log(name);

        displayName();
      }

      init();

      //init() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). The displayName
      //function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body
      //of the init() function. Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own.
      //However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, displayName() can
      //access the variable name declared in the parent function, init().

      function outer() {
        let carname = "BMW";
        // console.log(private);
        function innner() {
          let bikename = "yamaha";
          console.log(carname);
        //   console.log(private);
          function innertoo() {
            // let private = 'abc@123';
            console.log(carname);
            console.log(bikename);
          }
          innertoo();
        }
        innner();
      }
      outer();

      // in above outer function we can easily access carname within its inner and innertoo  function.

      // The lexical scope of inner function is outer funcion , all the variable is declared inside the
      //outer function can access inside inner function. but inner function cannot access the variable
      //present inside the innertoo function.

      // The lexical scope of innertoo function is outer funcion and inner function also, all the variable 
      // is declared inside the outer function and inner function can access inside innertoo function. but 
      // when we declare varialbe in innertoo function that cannot be access by outer and inner function.

      //thats is the reason , the above private variable won't access from outer and inner function.
